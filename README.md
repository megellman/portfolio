I created a professional portfolio webpage. On this page is a description about me, examples of my work, and information on how to contact me. I created this webpage to show future employers my work and to practice media responsive layouts.

## Learning Points
In doing this project, I learned how to create and customize the design of a scrollbar using CSS. This makes it much easier for users to interact with my webpage.

```
::-webkit-scrollbar {
    width: 20px;
}

::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
    background-color: #c4adaa;
}

::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
    background-color: #a89897;
}

::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover {
    background-color: #928988;
}
```
